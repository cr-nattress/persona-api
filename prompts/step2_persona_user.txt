Based on these cleaned notes about a person, create a comprehensive persona JSON:

!!! CRITICAL - READ FIRST !!!
At the TOP of the provided text, you will see a section marked with === DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ===.
This section contains AUTHORITATIVE data from the person database. You MUST use this data in the persona.

SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEMOGRAPHIC DATA:
- If first_name is listed in the === DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION === section, set meta.name to exactly "[first_name] [last_name]" or just "[first_name]"
- If last_name is listed in the === DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION === section, set meta.name to exactly "[first_name] [last_name]" or just "[last_name]"
- If both first_name and last_name are listed, set meta.name to EXACTLY "[first_name] [last_name]"
- If gender is listed in the === DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION === section, set meta.gender to EXACTLY that value
- NEVER override database demographics with different names or genders inferred from the narrative text
- ALWAYS use database demographics, even if different names or genders appear in the narrative

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR NAME EXTRACTION:
- You MUST populate the "meta.name" field with the person's actual name
- PRIORITY 1: If first_name and/or last_name are provided in the === DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION === section, use those EXACTLY
- PRIORITY 2: If no demographic name is provided, apply the NAME EXTRACTION STRATEGY:
  * Look for names that appear repeatedly across the provided text (cross-source consensus)
  * Identify names in formal/professional contexts: titles, headers, email addresses, contact info, signatures
  * Extract using linguistic patterns: "[Name] said...", "[Name] worked at...", "Name is...", professional headers
  * When multiple names appear, use the one appearing most frequently or in the most formal context
  * Distinguish person names from business/company names
  * PRIORITIZE explicit extraction over inference - only infer if the name is not directly stated
  * Use "Unknown" only as a last resort if the name cannot be extracted or reasonably inferred

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENDER:
- You MUST populate the "meta.gender" field
- PRIORITY 1: If gender is provided in the === DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION === section, use that value EXACTLY
- PRIORITY 2: If no demographic gender is provided, infer from the text using pronouns and context

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGE ESTIMATION:
- You MUST populate the "meta.age" field with a specific estimate (e.g., "42", "mid-40s", "35-45", "Late 40s")
- NEVER use "Unknown" for age
- Estimate based on career stage, life events, technology adoption, family status, or other contextual clues
- If age cannot be estimated from explicit clues, look for patterns (someone with 10+ years in a career is likely in their 30s-50s, etc.)

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR OTHER META FIELDS:
- Include all available identifying information: role, location, and other details
- When information comes from multiple sources, use consensus (if 2+ sources agree on a detail, it's reliable)
- Distinguish between explicitly stated facts vs. inferred information
