HopSkip empowers planners to source venues effortlessly, collaborate seamlessly, and contract confidently—helping them deliver exceptional meetings and events without the manual, time-consuming processes of the past.\n\nOver the years, I’ve built and scaled a VC-backed SaaS company serving planners, hotels, and destinations across the globe. Our platform simplifies sourcing for thousands of events annually, creating measurable impact for both planners and hospitality partners.\n\nI thrive at the intersection of innovation, growth, and operations—driving strategy, building high-performing teams, and delivering products that solve real-world problems. My experience spans leadership, SaaS growth, and operational excellence, with a focus on creating solutions that are as scalable as they are meaningful.\n\nAt Hopskip, we’re on a mission to modernize the meetings and events industry. I’m always excited to connect with leaders in hospitality, event planning, and tech who share our vision for the future of event sourcing.\n\nFeatured\n\nPost\n\nNeed to source a program ASAP but running low on bandwidth?\n\nFollow Joe Nishi's lead — the Managing Partner at Meeting Encore turned to HopSkip.\n\nAs Joe puts it: \"It saved our butts [...] and has been fantastic.”\n\nSee it for yourself by booking time with our team here: https://hubs.li/Q0389J1B0\n\n\n8 · 4 comments\n\nPost\n\n\"I hit a button, and Hopskip spits out an entire Excel spreadsheet that compares all my proposals apples to apples — which is amazing.

Before Hopskip, their team was juggling endless Excel tabs, missing details, and proposals that didn’t reflect the care they put into their work.\n\nToday, they’re sourcing smarter, collaborating faster, and presenting proposals that wow their clients.\n\nBuilding a startup is hard. The highs are high, the lows are humbling, and there’s no clear playbook. But stories like this — seeing real people and teams find clarity, save time, and impress their clients — make every challenge worth it. 🤝… more\n\n\nHopskip\n\n4,198 followers\n\nVisit website\n\n2w • \n\nFrom Excel chaos to sourcing clarity 📊 ➡️ ✨\n\nManaging 1,000+ events annually with spreadsheets and email?
