  "raw_text": "Chris Nattress is a Technical Lead at Smart Moving with 10+ years of software engineering experience. He's an analytical visionary who designs systems that make complexity feel simple. His career spans from founding Ski Resort Data Services (95% client retention) to leading microservices transformations at Inntopia (94% faster deployments, 60% reduction in development time) and Progressive Leasing (fintech platform processing $500M+ annually with 99.95% uptime). Currently leading global distributed teams across Asia and Latin America. Technical expertise spans C# .NET, Angular, Vue.js, React, AWS, Azure, microservices architecture, and AI integration. He's an early adopter of AI development tools (Windsurf, Cursor, Claude) and built an AI-powered portfolio at chrisnattress.com. His problem-solving approach follows: Observe → Deconstruct → Model → Prototype → Iterate → Integrate. Core principle: create frameworks that enable teams to solve similar problems independently. Values systems thinking, evidence-based decisions, documentation-first approach, and team enablement. Promoted to Technical Lead within 3 months at Progressive Leasing. Successfully mentored distributed teams and established standards across 5 teams. Prefers strategic autonomy within clear systems, complex architectural challenges, and organizations valuing documentation and continuous learning.",
