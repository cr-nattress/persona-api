About
As Co-Founder and CEO of Hopskip, I’m passionate about transforming how meeting and event planners source hotels. HopSkip empowers planners to source venues effortlessly, collaborate seamlessly, and contract confidently—helping them deliver exceptional meetings and events without the manual, time-consuming processes of the past.

Over the years, I’ve built and scaled a VC-backed SaaS company serving planners, hotels, and destinations across the globe. Our platform simplifies sourcing for thousands of events annually, creating measurable impact for both planners and hospitality partners.

I thrive at the intersection of innovation, growth, and operations—driving strategy, building high-performing teams, and delivering products that solve real-world problems. My experience spans leadership, SaaS growth, and operational excellence, with a focus on creating solutions that are as scalable as they are meaningful.

At Hopskip, we’re on a mission to modernize the meetings and events industry. I’m always excited to connect with leaders in hospitality, event planning, and tech who share our vision for the future of event sourcing.

"I hit a button, and Hopskip spits out an entire Excel spreadsheet that compares all my proposals apples to apples — which is amazing. That's the document I actually use to review bids with my stakeholders." 

In LaTika W.'s first year using Hopskip to streamline sourcing, she connected with 377 properties.

It's also how she initially connected with Jessica Jacobs, and helped create a compelling business case for her role's value to the National Society of Black Engineers.

Nothing better than hearing your customers share (unprompted) how much value they get from your product. 🙌

"I'm just in love with HopSkip... I get better results and faster responses from hotels. They input detailed information instead of just plugging in basic rates. As someone managing high-volume sourcing, I don't have time for back-and-forth 15 times on every little detail!" - Sarah Meister - Event Group Housing Expert | site & stay

Let’s be real — venue sourcing can be a grind. Manual RFPs. Spreadsheets everywhere. Stakeholders asking, “So how much did we actually save?”

That's why I'm co-hosting a live session with April Martz, our Product Manager at Hopskip, to show planners how to make sourcing not just easier — but smarter.  

We’ll walk through how to:
 ✅ Streamline RFPs with templates
 ✅ Compare hotel proposals side-by-side (including those sneaky fees)
 ✅ Build branded presentations in one click
 ✅ Use analytics and reporting to prove your impact

If you’re a planner who wants to spend less time chasing details and more time driving results, this one’s for you.

✅ An 8-step framework for crafting comprehensive RFPs
✅ Pro tips from experienced planners (like how date flexibility can save you thousands)

From Excel chaos to sourcing clarity 📊 ➡️ ✨

Managing 1,000+ events annually with spreadsheets and email? Meeting Encore Ltd. lived that reality. RFPs sent into the void, days chasing missing details, and proposals that looked like tax documents.

After switching to Hopskip, they saw:
✔️50% faster hotel response times
✔️30% time savings per RFP
✔️Client proposals that actually impressed

The real win? Getting their time back to focus on strategy instead of spreadsheet formatting.

"Our clients are loving the 'new look' of our proposals with hotel photos and information laid out in an easy-to-review format," says Grace McCullough, Client Ambassador at Meeting Encore.

If you're still battling Excel for event sourcing, there's a better way. Read the full story 👇

Stories like this are why we built Hopskip. 💚

When we started, our goal was simple — help event planners spend less time buried in spreadsheets and more time doing what actually matters: creating incredible experiences.

Six years later, it’s surreal to see that vision come to life with partners like Meeting Encore who manage over 1,000 events each year. Before Hopskip, their team was juggling endless Excel tabs, missing details, and proposals that didn’t reflect the care they put into their work.

Today, they’re sourcing smarter, collaborating faster, and presenting proposals that wow their clients.

Building a startup is hard. The highs are high, the lows are humbling, and there’s no clear playbook. But stories like this — seeing real people and teams find clarity, save time, and impress their clients — make every challenge worth it. 🤝… more
